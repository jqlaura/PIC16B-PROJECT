Tina Turner,My greatest beauty secret is being happy with myself. I don't use special creams or treatments - I'll use a little bit of everything.

Deborah Meaden,You need emotional intelligence; to be happy to take risks; to be competitive and to look forward not backwards.
Alison Gopnik,"Samuel Johnson called it the vanity of human wishes, and Buddhists talk about the endless cycle of desire. Social psychologists say we get trapped on a hedonic treadmill. What they all mean is that we wish, plan and work for things that we think will make us happy, but when we finally get them, we aren't nearly as happy as we thought we'd be."
Chris Cooper,"You look at a herd of cattle and well, they all look the same... but they know. They all have an individual personality, and those personalities change from day to day.

Konstantinos Karamanlis,"I invite all those who share my anxiety about, and hopes for, the future, and who burn with the desire for a political rebirth, to enlist with us.

Robert Baden-Powell,"My belief is that we were put into this world of wonders and beauty with a special ability to appreciate them, in some cases to have the fun of taking a hand in developing them, and also in being able to help other people instead of overreaching them and, through it all, to enjoy life - that is, to be happy."

Drew Barrymore,"I don't want to be stinky poo poo girl, I want to be happy flower child."
Metta World Peace,"I'm just happy that Jesus Christ, um, did not let me lose my teeth when I was 20 years old. 'Cause I was wondering, like, what if you kept your baby teeth until the age of 18 or 20, and then you lose 'em? That would look pretty bad."

Niecy Nash,"The soul of a woman is so important to maintain given all that is on our plates. Figuring out how to do it can be a little tricky. My prayer was, 'Lord, please help me.

Satyajit Ray,"For a film maker, an Oscar is like a Nobel Prize, you know. So I am very happy... delighted. There is nothing more after this. I cannot hope to get anything more prestigious."

Richard Corliss,"You know the fairy-tale drill, especially from the Disney versions: the heroines endure awful stuff in rites of passage that lead to a joyous resolution of, usually, marriage to a prince. 'Into the Woods' follows that template, then asks, 'What happens after Happy Ever After?'"
Lloyd Blankfein,"Mysterious can be cool, if you're in Hollywood and everyone's happy. But it can be really bad if people perceive that the financial interests are adversarial, that there's money versus people. A lot of Goldman Sachs people went into government, so at a time when there's a distrust of institutions, some of that reflects on us."
Trip Lee,"I think if you were to ask me when I was much younger what my definition of the good life was, I think it would have sounded a lot like what most people would say - a life with all the things you want and everything you think you need to make you happy, and these sorts of things."

Anna Torv,Some people just aren't meant to be happy.
Laura Wasser,"I'm not a divorce monger by any means, but if you're not happy in a relationship, and you've grown apart, it's not healthy for a couple to stay together. It's better for kids to see two happy parents than two miserable parents."

Ryan Potter,"I haven't been in the film world long enough to really understand the gravity of 'Big Hero's' success.

Saul Niguez,"Hard things make me happy. You get upset, but you mature and improve: the quicker you reach your best level, the longer you stay there. They say players peak at 28; I wanted to be there at 22, 23."
Rush Limbaugh,"There are many lessons people can learn about the left. One of the key lessons is they never give anything up. Once they begin a quest, they don't stop until they've got it. The other thing that you need to learn is, they're never happy even after they succeed. They are never happy because there can never be enough to satisfy them."

Logan Paul,"Creating content to make people smile and laugh, that's what makes me happy."
Tom Bodett,"I'm happy to report you still get nothing you don't need at Motel 6, and, therefore, you don't have to pay for it. I don't need valet parking. If I can drive the old crate 300 miles to the hotel all by myself, I can certainly handle the last nine feet to the parking space."
Rudy Boesch,"I was never destined to be a movie star, and I'm happy not being one."
John Oliver,"If I wanted to take a more activist or journalistic slant in work, I should probably just go be an activist or a journalist. But I'm happy being a comedian."

Shaun Ryder,When the Happy Mondays started I was like the dad of the band.
Terry McAuliffe,"I invested in many companies, and I'm happy this one worked. This is capitalism. You invest in stock, it goes up, it goes down. You know, if you don't like capitalism, you don't like making money with stock, move to Cuba or China."
Ryan Paevey,"I think what I like best about, and what keeps me coming back to work in the Hallmark world is similar to what keeps viewers coming back... of all of the places to go to make believe in TV, there has to be one that's a safe space, a happy place."
Katy Perry,"I think people appreciate a songwriter who shows different sides. The whole angst thing is cool, but if that's all you've got, it's just boring. Everything I write, whether it's happy or sad, has a sense of humor to it."
Lilly Singh,"'Unicorn Island' is the synonym for my happy place. It's a really beautiful message: that happiness is one of the hardest things you'll ever fight for, but it's the only thing worth fighting for."
Jurgen Klopp,"Yes, it is one of my ultimate aims - it is the ultimate sense of football: to make the people happy, to let them live some emotions that you usually can't get."

Kevin De Bruyne,"Money is important, but the most important thing for me is to play football, and then I'm happy. OK, you want to earn a good amount of money to be secure, but if I chose money, I would go to Russia and already have a lot more. I like to play football, and that is it."
Goldie Hawn,"I noted that people are happy here in India. When I went back home, people had everything in the materialistic sense and were surrounded with abundance, but they were not happy."

Danny Ings,"As long as we're winning, I'm happy."
Ileana D'Cruz,"I don't think I constantly have to be on a promotional spree or be seen in the newspapers every day or even be part of social parties and film gangs. I'm having my own set of journey, and I am happy with it because I don't want to be like everybody."

Syd Barrett,"A lot of people want to make films and do photography and things, but I'm quite happy doing what I'm doing."
Jordi Molla,My label is to play bad guys of Latin origin in American movies. I'm happy with that label. I prefer to play that than to play a city boy. The bad guy is always something very tempting for the audience.

Dolores O'Riordan,"I lived in buses. I didn't really have anything else. I didn't feel like a female, and I ended up really kind of isolated. Everybody thinks you're so happy and so wealthy and such a big star, but you're really kind of lonely and don't know how to stop it."
Chris Connelly,I've been drawn to sports stories that have an emotional component to it. I'm happy to get a chance to tell a few.

Just couldn't be happier with life, really."
Joseph Hume,"With an open trade in corn and a fixed duty we should have every man in the country fully fed and happy, instead of our present situation in which so much distress exists - distress of our own producing."
