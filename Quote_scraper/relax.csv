Stella Maxwell,"Personally, I like to be at home, relax, and just be around my friends."

Giada De Laurentiis,"I count on chiropractic sessions to keep my body aligned. Standing for hours can impact my posture, and that can throw the rest of my body out of whack.

Nick Saban,I don't ever want the players to relax in a game.

Christopher Lambert,"To relax, I work."
Victoria Moran,Your body has something in the neighborhood of 40 trillion cells - quite a consulting committee. Call on it when you're confused or undecided. Relax quietly and ask your body what it has to say.

Jay Williams,"I'm a young-old guy. I go home, I don't need to go out, and I watch TV on my couch and relax, maybe have a cigar here or there. A couple of the coaches tell me, 'You're old school for someone who's young.'"
Richard Rogers,"The Ranelagh Gardens in Chelsea provide plenty of opportunities to walk, think and relax."
Alan Dershowitz,"Ed Koch will never 'rest in peace.' That was not his way. He was always nervously squirming, while making others squirm as well. Comfort was not his goal.

Travis Bradberry,"If you can't relax during your interview, then nothing you do to prepare will matter. Being yourself is essential to the selection process, and interviewers will feel it if you're too nervous. Showing fear or anxiety appears weak compared to a relaxed smile and genuine confidence."
Hilary Farr,Great kitchens are a must-have. A place to relax and cook for friends and family. A gathering place for family of all ages and guests is a staple for me as well.
Juan Mata,"I think every footballer, after 20 years playing football, the first thing that comes to your mind is to relax."

Akon,"While I'm here, I'm gonna milk it for all I can, so when I'm no longer hot - and I know that day is coming - I will step over here and enjoy everything I've created up to this point. The music is just opening all these doors, so I can relax."
David Suchet,"I love music, especially classical like Verdi; it's a great way to relax."
Michio Kaku,"When I get bored, or get stuck on an equation, I like to go ice skating, but it makes you forget your problem. Then you can tackle the problem with a fresh new insight. Einstein liked to play the violin to relax. Every physicist likes to have a past time. Mine is ice skating."
Pat McAfee,"For players you don't hear about in the news, they enjoy the hell out of the offseason. They can travel and see things they never thought they'd see, or go back home to relax and see their kids and family that they haven't had a chance to hang out with in a few months."
Terry Rozier,"Once you get comfortable playing hard, a lot of things just go your way. You just relax more, and you feel like you can do a lot of things."

King Krule,"When I was younger, I used to do that a lot: I would hear a part of a song that would really relax me and then put it on repeat. That would send me to sleep. It was quite obvious classical music, people like Penguin Cafe Orchestra, Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel."
May-Britt Moser,"I've trained myself to find time to exercise relaxation of the body. I have these programs - I just listen to the instructions, and they're simple. Sometimes you just hold your hand tight and keep your breath - you hold it, hold it, feel all the tension, and then relax."

Taryn Manning,Some people might say I need to learn how to relax.

Mary Decker,"I've always got such high expectations for myself. I'm aware of them, but I can't relax them."

Rachael Ray,"I used to work in kitchens, doing 12 or more hours a day of physical labor, so today, eight to 12 hours of cooking, chatting or filming feels like a vacation. When I have a scheduled 'day off,' I spend several hours writing, then I clean until I crash from fatigue. I don't relax well."
Alfonso Ribeiro,If you actually relax your vocal cords they actually work better.
Ryan Seacrest,A friend of mine has a house with a basketball court and a pool. The guys go over and play basketball; I lie by the pool and nap in the sun. That defines me.

Anna Kendrick,"You can relax more when you're playing a silly character than when you're playing a really rigid character. But to be fair, I think George Clooney is a bigger teenager than any of the 'Twilight' cast. He's the guy throwing a football at your head and then hiding around the corner, pretending it wasn't him!"
Janice Dickinson,"I relax, meditate and do 80 minutes of yoga every day."

Kathy Reichs,I tend to watch a lot of movies at home. It's nice to be close to the refrigerator with my pyjamas on and just relax.
Monica Potter,During the week it isn't always easy to sit down together and I am usually in a rush to get everyone off to school. A bowl of cereal and milk with fruit is perfect because it's quick and easy. I like to mix it up on the weekends when we can all relax in our pajamas.
Laura Marling,"It is quite hard to relax in London. I always say I'd move somewhere quieter, but I am a bit of a confirmed urbanite now - it crept up on me without me noticing. I always think that I function quite well on my own, unusually so, but then I'm reminded how important people are to me."

Cat Power,"For me, the moment the mic is on and it's rolling, it's impossible to vocally relax for some reason.

Jhonen Vasquez,"I love zombies. I don't know how else to answer that... I have trouble falling asleep, so there are certain scenarios I use in my head to relax. I find sniping zombies very relaxing."
Benny Blanco,"I always have a ping-pong table in the studio. If you're with an artist and you notice the situation is going south a little bit, it's like, 'You wanna play ping-pong or foosball?' Or, 'You wanna go grab somethin' to eat?' And then you just like talk to them and relax them and get them comfortable and get yourself comfortable."
Ruzwana Bashir,"Before redeye flights, I drink copious amounts of herbal brews to help me relax and fall asleep after takeoff."
Fred Armisen,"I can't relax. I'm not happy unless I'm working on stuff. 'SNL' is always a huge workload, as enjoyable as it is."
Chris Liddell,I don't sit down and relax very much. I don't desire to.
Moby,I love to be busy. I'm envious of people who are able to take their spare time and relax. All I like to do is work. Perhaps it's lingering Calvinist guilt?
Bobbi Brown,"I don't relax very well, and I find it hard to sit still."
Warren Moon,"Throughout my career, I was never able to relax; I always had to go on the field with another responsibility. I felt like I was playing, not just for my team, but for my race."
Noel Gallagher,"I have 3 kids and a cat and a busy, noisy house. I get more time to relax when I'm working."

Jessica Lowndes,"I do a lot of writing on planes, actually. It's my time that I can just relax and have absolutely no distractions."
John Oliver,I can't relax. I find vacations problematic.
Jamie Bamber,The problem with the treadmill is I just don't know what to do in my head. You either stare at the mirror or concentrate on the TV. It makes me ill because I can't relax on a treadmill.

Mark Romanek,"I think that I've learned to relax, and trust in and hire very talented people, and trust in their abilities a little more."
Jean-Pierre Leaud,"I always felt that with an Antoine Doinel film, Truffaut was taking a vacation, that Francois could relax when making a Doinel film. All of the language came to him very easily. 'The 400 Blows,' I felt, was a collage of all his childhood experiences. Every time he felt an Antoine Doinel film was necessary, he'd make one."
Adam Savage,"I'm always going to be making costumes. It's one of the ways I relax my brain. In addition to the pleasure of having the piece, there is a deep and abiding pleasure for me assembling something in my head - learning to know something in its totality in my head, and then putting together all the constituent parts into a cohesive whole."
Salma Hayek,"Somehow I am really relaxed within the chaos of having a baby - and anyone who's a mother knows it's very hard to relax, because there is so much to do and worry about!"
Xavi,I don't actually watch many shows. I will either watch movies or football. I enjoy to watch games in the Premier League and will also watch movies a lot as well. That is how I relax.
Kourtney Kardashian,"When every moment is constantly being filmed, it's hard to relax."
Mario Testino,"When I had photographed Prince William's mother, I brought along a CD of Dalida, a French singer, that we played on set all day to relax everyone. I decided to do the same thing for Catherine and William. The contrast of the contemporary informal music playing in the beautiful rooms with so much history caused a lot of laughter."
Henrik Lundqvist,"When I try to relax, it's more Swedish rock, softer music, and I go out and do fun stuff. I play guitar, but it doesn't matter really what it is - just something that keeps you away from hockey."
Bipasha Basu,"You don't have to do offbeat films to prove that you can act. I have done it but only to prove myself that I can fit convincingly into every kind of films. I want to do the 100 crore film where the hero does all the work, and I get to relax."
Seth Numrich,"If I could go back to my first year of acting school, I'd probably say: 'Relax. Stop taking yourself so seriously.'"
Carl Honore,"Our obsession with speed, with cramming more and more into every minute, means that we race through life instead of actually living it. Our health, diet and relationships suffer. We make mistakes at work. We struggle to relax, to enjoy the moment, even to get a decent night's sleep."
Rose George,"It's difficult on a ship to get away from your job because that accommodation house, which is where seafarers live, is their workplace, it's where they live, it's where they relax, it's everything, and it's just hard to get away. And seafarers often refer to their job as being in prison with a salary."
Jack Reynor,"'Transformers' gives people the ability to relax and rest for three hours. That's a substantial amount of time, given how plugged in to our devices we are. People don't give themselves enough time to sit down. They're no longer comfortable with themselves."
Nick Ferguson,"Like most athletes, I like to go home and relax. I try not to bring the game home with me. I might play some video games that are, let's just say, for mature audiences only. And I might get some flak for this, but I like to watch 'Seinfeld.' Sometimes, laughter is the best medicine."
Carrie Underwood,"The TV is often on in our house, but I really only keep up with three shows: 'American Idol,' 'Modern Family' and 'The Walking Dead.' Sometimes I'll sip red wine - it's a nice way to slow down and relax."
Landon Donovan,"I've always been active - outdoors, on the beach, playing - and so to go home and have to sit on my couch and relax... it's frustrating. Sometimes, you just have to really shut yourself down."
Taissa Farmiga,"I have a rebellious teenage thing. If my mom says I can't do it, I'm gonna do it. But I'm pretty good. That's why it was fun to play Sam in 'The Bling Ring.' I got to be someone crazy and wild to the extreme, then go home and relax and get rid of the burden."
Kimberley Nixon,"I'd just got back from filming my role as Flo in 'Kidnap & Ransom' when I got the news that Channel 4 had re-commissioned 'Fresh Meat,' so I think it was the first Christmas I could actually relax knowing that I had three months' work sorted. As an actor, that's always a good feeling."
Gregg Sulkin,"If I had any advice to give people, it would be to relax; never treat an audition like an emergency. There will be plenty more in your career. If you think you messed up, you probably didn't. And if you did mess up, it's not the end of the world."
Tabatha Coffey,"I think a lot of us feel the need to always be connected, and finding time to relax and sometimes play is something that I think we all need to make more time for, especially me."
Hattie Morahan,"When you're young and starting out, the big hurdle is to relax enough in rehearsal so that you don't feel intimidated. The more work you've done, the more you can experiment in rehearsal and not have to worry about getting the sack."
Kate Bush,"I listen to very little music, particularly contemporary. If I listen to it, it's going to be my own music, some arrangement or something. I spend so much time listening that the way I relax is by watching things, a comedy; that's my way to wind down."
Nick Nolte,"How do I relax? Meditate, I guess. I quit golf. You twist your back and get all cranked up."
Paul Haggis,"I like taking genres and subverting them. I did that with 'In the Valley of Elah.' I said, 'Okay, this is just a murder mystery. Relax.' And then, two thirds of the way through, I broke every convention of a murder mystery."
Luke Evans,"It's good for your body to have a break. Even when you're training, you have to have a cheat day every week. The body reacts better to training if you give it intervals of not training, or you relax the diet."
Juan Pablo Galavis,There are people who love on weekends to go out when the sun comes out. I just want to lie in bed and watch sports and relax.

Matt Flynn,"I feel like, if the guys can look at me in the huddle and see a calm and collected face, that they're going to relax a little bit. The way I look at it, leadership and being that guy is, don't be someone you're not. Don't be a hoorah guy jumping around and clapping your hands if you're not that guy."
Gautam Singhania,"Work and play go hand in hand. A lot of people want to work, work, and work until 40, and then relax. Who says you'll get to 40? Or 50? Who knows what'll happen in the next five minutes? The only reality is the present. And if you can't learn to live in the moment, you'll never be content."
Tony Ross,I don't relax. My main relaxation is meeting illustrators and publishers in restaurants and bars.

Philippe Petit,"On one day of the week, I relax - which is not true, I work furiously on other things. 'Relax' is not a word to me."
Henry Petroski,I relax by looking at things and reading about things. Even the simplest thing can reveal a great deal about the world around us. It relaxes me greatly to sit back with my feet up and look around my study at the everyday things that surround me.
Edie Campbell,People need to take a breath and remember that it's only fashion. Relax. No one's going to die.
Zhu Zhu,"Sometimes I'll do a mask if I had a lot of makeup on that day or was out in the sun. I like a hydrogen mask. It's an easy one, and it's supposed to soothe and relax your skin."
Kevin Whately,"Put me on telly, and I think I have a relaxation on camera that makes an audience relax, too. It's not a conscious thing. Cameras don't bother me, whereas other people try to perform to them."
Kevin Whately,The real reason I love Bamburgh is that it's the only place in the world where I ever truly relax.
David Alpay,"To relax, I do yoga and meditate and do little math problems, and it's fun to check that part of your brain off and turn on a different part."
Peter Capaldi,"I'm creative. I can't relax unless I've got some project on the go. I'm somebody from art school, and art school during the punk era, when you just had a go at whatever came along."
Nikki Reed,"Being an actor, you have to be working even when you're not working. You never really get to relax because anytime you're relaxing in between jobs, you're just worried that you're not going to get another job."
"Isiah Whitlock, Jr.","Usually, when you're working or you're on set, everything is very guarded. At parties, people have a tendency to relax."
Mary Ellen Mark,"I don't relax. I can't take vacations. I'm obsessive-compulsive, and I worry with every project that I'm going to fail. When it starts to go well, and I sense that something beautiful and important and meaningful is being created, it's a fantastic feeling, and I find it very hard to stop."
Mark Billingham,"When a crime writer thinks up a delicious twist, it is a great moment. Time to relax and take the rest of the day off. I do think that it can be overdone, however."
Wolfgang Ketterle,"Running is a way for me to relax. With one hour of intense running, I can get a lot of physical exercise. I can relax my body. I feel a tension in my muscles when I don't run. In that sense, I need to get out a few times a week in order to do my work as a scientist, which involves a lot of sitting still."
Joan Kirner,"I'm a workaholic. I would not pretend to be anything else. I rarely go to bed before one o'clock in the morning. I might kind of have a spa between half-past twelve and one and relax, and that's when I do my thinking, or my non-thinking. That's when I have a bit of space for myself."
Charlotte McKinney,"I love fitness, yoga. I love fashion. On the weekends, I try to relax. I have pretty crazy weeks. I like spas and nice dinners. I'm not much of a club person. I like to hang on the beach in Malibu."
Jonathan Galassi,"One thing I have noticed is that when you're a younger editor, you're more intense about it. As you go along, you relax a little. More and more, I feel that the book is the author's. You give the author your thoughts, and it's up to him or her to decide what to do."
Rob Gronkowski,"Just put football first, or your job first. Give everything you've got all week, work hard, work super-hard to take it to the next level every week. And when you feel like you got to the point where you want to be, you definitely need the time to go out, relax, have a good time, take all the stress off it."
Marshall Curry,"When you are interviewing someone, never let your camera person turn off the camera. The second you turn off the camera, they'll say the magic thing that you'd been looking for the whole interview. People want to relax after the performance is done. Don't be afraid of awkward silence. That is your friend."
Marshall Curry,"A lot of filmmaking is an endurance contest between you and the people you're filming. Every time that you relax, I promise you, something interesting will happen."
Ronda Rousey,"A lot of people, once they become champion, they relax, kind of sit in the position and try to enjoy it. But I feel like everything I've ever worked for could be lost at any moment. I work harder and harder and harder, because I want to be farther ahead with every fight, and not worrying about these girls catching up to me."
Elise Andrew,"I sleep five or six hours a night, then crash at the weekend. I'm learning to eat properly and exercise. I relax by watching silly sitcoms like 'Scrubs' and 'How I Met Your Mother.'"
Heather Graham,"I definitely like not working sometimes. It's so fun. I just love sleeping in. In America, everyone is driven to succeed and wake up and do something. But I don't care. I want to sleep in. I want to relax. I don't want to have to get up every day."

Milos Raonic,I have an inability after matches are over to sort of switch off and relax completely.
Carmen Marton,"When I set my eyes on the gold at the world championships, I was able to maintain that focus that whole day. That's what I aim to do in Rio - my focus is gold, so I can keep in that good state; I can't get too complacent. I can't relax; I can't be content. I need to be 100 per cent switched on."
Sean Bean,"In theatre, once you've got the character and you've got things together, you can relax into it. Film has a different feel - you don't get that through line of not stopping. Theatre is like a snowball gathering momentum and getting bigger, whereas in film, it's a bit stop and start - but you do tend to adjust to that quite easily."
Victoria Beckham,Bottom line: I can relax in L.A. I think I'm the only person in that town who doesn't want to act. I was an OK singer. I was an OK dancer. But acting? Never could do it.
Hannah Mills,"I like to relax a lot the night before a race. I like having people around me. I don't like being on my own, particularly. Music helps psych you up, too."

Katie Taylor,I always come into these competitions hoping to come away with a gold medal. I won't relax until I have the gold medal around my neck.

Leonard Cohen,I've never sold widely enough to be able to relax about money. I had two kids and their mother to support and my own life. So there was never an option of cutting out.

Toni Collette,I think it's important to relax in general. I don't try to save up my relaxing for one month period of the year; it's kind of a daily practice that I've tried to remain aware of.
Guy Fieri,"After a show, people say, 'I bet you want to just sit back and relax.' No way. First thing I want to do when I'm home is cook."
Kurt Elling,"Out in L.A., things relax even further than they do in Chicago. There's such a looseness to it, and there's a potentially refreshing advantage to that."
Jamie Vardy,"You do get a chance to think about things when you're at home, but that is when you want to relax and forget about football for a bit. Honestly, you don't really get time to stop and think about things. We have a job to do. That is all we concentrate on, going game by game."
D. B. Sweeney,"On a movie set, there's so much down time, adjusting the lighting. It gave me time to nap, call my friends, relax, work out. But with TV, there's no break time. None."
Parker Posey,"I work with directors who haven't had the experience of being on sets as much as I have. I feel like, in a way, if it's an independent movie, I can teach the crew to kind of relax, or create a vibe. It really is about a vibe."
Jane Lynch,"The world, universe, God, whatever you call it, has so much more in store if you just sit back and relax and do what's right in front of you."

Charlie Hunnam,I'm starting to get old. I want to eat some hamburgers and just relax.
J. J. Watt,"It's hard to understand the life that I live and rationalize some of the things that I do. I don't need someone questioning every move that I make, asking me why I don't just relax. When there's no one asking me those types of questions... to me, it's peaceful."
Carson Wentz,"For me, I stay pretty focused on football, and then at the end of the day, you just go home and relax."

Moses Malone,"I did 21 years of hard labor in the NBA, invested my money right, so I'm set. I earned the right to relax and enjoy, you know?"
Luke Roberts,"I give everything far too much thought. If you think you know what you're doing, then you can kind of relax, and then you can improvise and play and just enjoy the day rather than be chasing the lines."
Mel B,"I didn't want my daughter to grow up in that intense attention - wherever we went, we'd get paparazzi. There are bigger, better superstars in America, so I thought, 'I'll go there for a quick holiday, and relax.' And my holiday just turned into me loving it and wanting to stay there longer and longer."
Sylvia Day,"I have things I watch in my downtime - I love 'Scandal.' I don't write political romance, so there's not a direct relation there. But it's something I do just to turn off the brain for a little bit, and just to relax and recharge."
Lewis Howes,Meditating is easier than most people think. Start by focusing and following your breath. The goal is not to eliminate thoughts entirely but to continually return to your breath.

Kristaps Porzingis,You can never really relax until you've signed that contract with your team.

Holly Hunter,"The first and most important thing you need to be creative is to relax, particularly for the actors."

Malik Jackson,I like to relax and get my mind off of business for a few hours.
Claudio Ranieri,"The day my players relax, I get crazy. They know that."
Mark Rylance,"It's amazing how much the sense of telling a story with a beginning, middle, and end helps me to relax. I find that the mass of stories that one is subjected to living one's life is otherwise overwhelming."
Emily Weiss,"My brain puts baths in the same category as yoga: it'd be 'nice' to relax for an hour, but I just want a 10-minute, high-impact workout; get in, get out. Showers are my cardio."
Seth Rollins,It's nice when I have days off to go home and relax and literally take the weight off my shoulders and enjoy the simple things.
Liu Wen,"I just wear very nice pyjamas. When I'm at home, I love to watch movies and relax because when I'm modeling, I'm always travelling. When I'm not working I don't put much make up, but I do love nail polish for that little bit of fun colour."
Freja Beha Erichsen,"I love to have massages, I think it's really important to relax. In New York, I usually go to Massage Williamsburg or Great Jones Spa."
Ray Fearon,"The important thing with memorising a part is not to force it. Sometimes when you're rehearsing, you'll think it's not going in, but it is. On stage, you have to trust that the lines are there, because they are. The real challenge is to relax."
Nick Wooster,"Bloggers and stores and publications and brands and houses all need to sort of take a deep breath and relax because no one is going away. The brands aren't going away. The designers, bloggers, publications aren't going away."
Laurie Hernandez,"On Sundays, I just love to go to church and then relax the whole day!"

Rachel Simmons,"No matter how much you urge them to relax and how much you mean it, your child probably grapples with highly stressful environments away from home, whether it's where they go to school, the teams they play on, or the peers in their social circle. Most teenagers I know long for empathy from their parents about their struggle."
Jim Broadbent,"An Oscar clears the deck of envy and resentment. You think, 'Well, I've got that. I can relax now.'"

Mandy Ingber,"Yoga will uplift you if you are feeling sluggish or down, relax you if you feel high-strung, and soften your edges if you are feeling angry."
Dinesh Paliwal,"At home, I relax by catching up with friends."
David Hepworth,"Bobby Bones is a young country DJ who does a widely syndicated morning show.

Guests are encouraged to relax on Bones's couch and talk about anything they like."

Kevin Parker,"I think after a long tour and after an album, your brain feels like it wants to relax, but at the same time, making music for me is something that comes kind of naturally. Just like a brain process."
Logic,My girlfriend has to beat me up to get me to relax because I work all the time.
Kevin Macdonald,"The things that are hardest to shoot are the things where you want people just to feel very natural, and you want to do love scenes, and you want to do just kids hanging out and trying to get them to relax."
Rose Namajunas,"People think after the fight you get to sit around and relax and all that. But really, people come around and family and all that, so it's a whole 'nother responsibility you have to take care of."
Nafessa Williams,"I love, love, love Lauryn Hill's 'MTV Unplugged.' It just helps relax me. I love just where she was in her space with that album and the truth that she was telling."

George Pelecanos,I can't relax. I don't have any hobbies.
Gennady Golovkin,"I went to university every day for five years. I thought, 'I must - must - go to school.' Look, my hands, these are like guns. When you have guns, you can relax. But in the future, you need something else."
Leroy Sane,To relax in the Premier League is not good.
Leroy Sane,"For me, it is important to get away from football, to calm down, relax, and have fun with family and friends."
Kurt Warner,"The thing about the Super Bowl is, once you got to the Super Bowl City, it was non-stop football, 24/7. You couldn't get away from it. You couldn't leave your hotel room and not get bombarded by fans. You couldn't go have a nice dinner and relax. Friends and family weren't there, so the normalcy of life changed."
Gerard Pique,"If you stop now and start to realise what you have achieved, then you start to relax, and you start to lose. I don't think about everything I have achieved. I will do it when I retire because then I will have a lot of days to remember."
Taapsee Pannu,"Doing films like 'Judwaa' helps me relax, and that should be my reason for doing it, not to compensate for doing films like 'Pink.'"

Roberto Firmino,"I do have moments when I like to relax, but I'm always moving, and that has always been the case since I was a boy."
Mike O'Malley,"We know, in history, people are unable to put different elements together and create gold, yet it's what you're asking actors to do every day. You're asking them to relax enough with the confines and restrictions of the lights and the cameras, and you gotta hit this mark, to relax enough to create what seems wonderful and beautiful."
Maurizio Sarri,"I love England, it's my home now. But I've been to the city, the centre of London, very little, as I don't really relax."
Akira Toriyama,"I'm a lazy person, but if I'm not absent-mindedly doing something, I can't really relax. I can't just veg out."

Joe Satriani,"You have to have a sound that inspires you to play because, if not, you won't be able to make the sound you have work. You won't be able to make magic with it if you're not happy with it, so it's important that you at least please yourself to the level where you can just relax and be an artist."
Jesse Lingard,"You train hard all week, and in your downtime, you can relax with your friends and have fun."

Edin Dzeko,"After I finish with football, I will definitely go home. I won't stay in England, but I like it here, and I'm happy I'm doing what's best to give everything on the pitch, and then when I can, I relax. But the only bad thing is here maybe the rain is much more than in my country, but everything else I am happy with."
Tulisa,"In the past, I may have felt quite trapped - rebelled a little bit and been quite defensive and not known how to relax."

Can you take it all a little bit more philosophically and put it more in perspective?' The tragedy is that I have to tell them, 'No. If anything, it gets worse.'"

Imran Tahir,"Playing for South Africa is an absolute honour, and I don't feel like I need to relax. Every game I take more than seriously."

Steph Houghton,"You get the best out of the girls when they're enjoying themselves, when they've got a smile on their face - they're working hard on the training pitch, but they're allowed to relax off it as well."
Mel Giedroyc,"I talked to friends who are actors and who do Shakespeare loads, and they all said 'learn it so that your family wants to clobber you, they're so bored.'

That's how difficult it is for the so-called smaller clubs."
