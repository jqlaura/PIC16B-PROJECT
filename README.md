# PIC16B-PROJECT: Emotion detection using facial recognization webapp


Resources Required

Since our project involves emotion detection, we need to have a large data set that has many images of faces. Thankfully, we are able to find one link to this type of data set from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ananthu017/emotion-detection-fer. In addition, we also plan to do some web scraping for reflection purposes. For example, scraping some videos/images/quotes to make users feel more positive based on their current mood (If the users are feeling sad, our system will automatically send something funny as a response; if the users are feeling angry, our system will automatically send something relaxing as a response). Therefore, we still need one or more resources to help us achieve this goal.

Tools and Skills Required

The tools and skills we required are:
- TensorFlow (machine learning)
- Sqlite3 (database connection, SQL command)
- Flask (developing web app)
- Scrapy (web scraping)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly (data visualization)
- Sklearn (preprocessing, confusion matrix, etc.)
- Pandas + Numpy (data analysis)
- GitHub (software collaboration)

What You Will Learn

By completing this project, we are able to learn how to train a TensorFlow model to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression in one of the categories, such as happy, unhappy, neutral, and so forth. After we finish optimizing this machine learning model, we will learn how to transfer this functionality to a visually rich webapp while introducing user interaction features and applying real-time web scraping techniques. Last but not least, every member of our team will learn how to work with others and handle issues that only arise in groups. In the end, all of us will develop strong teamwork skills.
