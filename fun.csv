Maya Angelou,"Don't get older just to get wiser. If you get older, you will be wiser, I believe that - if you dare. But get older because it's fun!"

Allyson Felix,"The biggest way I stay motivated is to run with a group of friends. Sometimes it's hard to get going by yourself, but if you have a plan and a meeting time, you know this run will happen for sure. It's a way to have fun - while also getting in a workout. Plus it distracts from pain, helps you fight fatigue, and gives you that extra push."
Bethany Mota,"For my fragrance, I knew I wanted something sweet but with a different side to it. I have a lot of vanilla notes and bakery shop scents, but then I also have muskier notes that make it a bit edgier. It's fun but also sophisticated."
Tulisa,"Don't get me wrong: if I'm having fun, I'm going to have fun. But I need a lot of quiet time."

Ben Feldman,"My aunt is a famous L.A. chef, Susan Feniger, and she's got Street and Border Grill. So a fun night out for me is to go to my aunt's restaurants."

Oliver Jackson-Cohen,"It's never fun having to bulk up for a job on an action film, then lose weight for another role. I don't actually mind working out, but it's the diet: I'm half-French, so I love my food, and boiled chicken breast for breakfast is not my idea of a good meal."
Chuck Liddell,"I was in 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' with Jack Nicholson. That was fun. I think I made, like, $33 or something. I got to miss a whole day of school, and when you're a little kid, that's cool."

It's very different, but it's so much fun."

Yara Shahidi,"Never jeopardize who you are for a role. Now, I'm not saying you should never change for a role, because the fun of being different characters is adapting different nuances and different parts of the character, but never jeopardize your moral compass or anything like that to have a role."
Noam Chomsky,Civil disobedience is - it's no fun.
Bo Burnham,"Postmodern comedy doesn't work well with very old audiences, because it's making fun of the comedy they enjoy."

Tobey Maguire,"The most attention I get is in a book store or video shop when I go to the foreign film section. Sometimes that can be fun, but usually those women want to talk about philosophy or something very dense. It's not like they're tearing off my shirt, you know."
Jeremy Renner,I used to hang out at karaoke bars all the time. It was the most fun you could have when you had no money.

Joe Lycett,"I've developed a fun text when a friend has just had a baby. I ask a classic question: 'Are you sleeping?'

It's then when I swoop in: 'It'll all be worth it when they're softly stroking your hair as you slip into oblivion.'"

Sanjay Dutt,"Kolkata is a great city, has great food and great people. We had some problems finding the kind of old buildings we were looking for, and even handling the crowds, but on the whole it was fun shooting there."
Anne Hathaway,"I think fashion is a lot of fun. I love clothes. More than fashion or brand labels, I love design. I love the thought that people put into clothes.

Kristen Bell,I have the best roommates in the world! It creates a fun sense of family... and that's really important to me. Things can get so lonely without it.

John Grisham,"Nobody wants to read about the honest lawyer down the street who does real estate loans and wills. If you want to sell books, you have to write about the interesting lawyers - the guys who steal all the money and take off. That's the fun stuff."
Joe Gold,"That's the object of going to a gym, having fun."
Adam Ondra,"What really motivates me to climb harder and harder is not necessarily that I want to push my limits or show who's best, but climbing harder and harder routes makes it more fun."

Howlin' Wolf,I just play blues for fun.

Ben Affleck,I'm not the type of guy who enjoys one-night stands. It leaves me feeling very empty and cynical. It's not even fun sexually. I need to feel something for the woman and entertain the vain hope that it may lead to a relationship.
Simone Biles,Always work hard and have fun in what you do because I think that's when you're more successful. You have to choose to do it.
Ellen Datlow,"Horror isn't only about ghosts or monsters. For example, paranormal romance seems the antithesis of horror. Once you have a sexy, fun vampire who is sweet, and you have a happy ending, it's not horror."
William Feather,Setting a good example for your children takes all the fun out of middle age.

N'Golo Kante,My team-mates at Chelsea have told me about the 'Kante-facts.' It is just a bit of fun. I obviously do not cover 30 per cent of the surface of the earth.
Pico Iyer,Nearly everybody I know does something to try to remove herself to clear her head and to have enough time and space to think... All of us instinctively feel that something inside us is crying out for more spaciousness and stillness to offset the exhilarations of this movement and the fun and diversion of the modern world.

Buddy Hackett,"Golf is more fun than walking naked in a strange place, but not much."
Brene Brown,"If I feel good about my parenting, I have no interest in judging other people's choices.

We're hard on each other because we're using each other as a launching pad out of our own perceived deficiency."
Betty White,"I was an only child and I had a mother and father who were just - there wasn't a straight man in the house, and I mean that in a very nice way. They were fun, and we would laugh a lot."
Ginger Rogers,"Sure, jets are fast and economical, but, oh my, what fun we've lost and what leisure we've sacrificed in the race to efficiency. Somehow, stepping onto a plane and zooming across the United States in a matter of hours doesn't hold a candle to the dear, old-fashioned train ride."
Derek Jeter,"You're playing a game, whether it's Little League or Game 7 of the Word Series. It's impossible to do well unless you're having a good time. People talk about pressure. Yeah, there's pressure. But I just look at it as fun."
W. Edwards Deming,The prevailing system of management has crushed fun out of the workplace.

Russell Baker,"Newspaper people, once celebrated as founts of ribald humor and uncouth fun, have of late lost all their gaiety, and small wonder."
Masahiro Sakurai,Game development is very difficult. Nobody sets out to create a game that's not fun.

I think playing those thousands of games is the single best and easiest way to learn from my predecessors.
Roger Penrose,Science and fun cannot be separated.

James Thurber,"The dog has got more fun out of Man than Man has got out of the dog, for the clearly demonstrable reason that Man is the more laughable of the two animals."
Harry Anderson,It's an old Elizabethan idea. The fool is the only one who is allowed to make fun of the king because he is a fool. I can say whatever I want about anybody else because I'm just an idiot talking - I'm not insisting that I'm any smarter than anyone else. It's satire.
Alex Jones,"The globalists are smart and tell us sin is fun, sin is a red-devil cheerleader."
Kevin Nealon,I loved working on 'Happy Gilmore' because I love to travel to new places and we got to go to British Columbia. Any Adam Sandler film is fun to work on because it is a reunion of the boys club of guys that have worked together in the past.
Jennifer Coolidge,"I live in New Orleans part of the year, and it's a really fun eating town. I bought two homes there, one to live in and one as an investment. They love to eat, drink and dress up in costumes. There are so many reasons to dress up - Mardi Gras, Halloween, Southern Decadence."
Alan Thicke,Fitness needs to be perceived as fun and games or we subconsciously avoid it.
Joe Rogan,"Stand-up is still my favorite, but the podcast is a close second. It's so fun, and it's given me the opportunity to have three-hour conversations with people I wouldn't have otherwise been able to talk to. When I talked to Maynard Keenan from Tool, I almost couldn't believe it was happening."
Mike Rowe,"I can say the willingness to get dirty has always defined us as an nation, and it's a hallmark of hard work and a hallmark of fun, and dirt is not the enemy."

Sam Allardyce,The bonding of the team is exceptionally important and trying to create a good team spirit and to have some fun.
Patrick Carney,"The Midwest breeds funny, eccentric people, to varying degrees. You play shows not because you're expecting to get a record deal, but to do something fun outside of mowing lawns. Everything else is just gravy... Or mustard."
Wendy Williams,"People love to throw stones at me, and I get it. It's fun to make fun of me, because I put myself out there. I'm a large personality, and I got the funny bone; I voice my opinion, and then people get upset."
CC Sabathia,"I remember one time in my junior year, in my art class, our teacher had us doing, like, finger paints, and I went and put a stripe on a girl's shirt, and it turned into a big paint fight. Paint all over the walls, all over everybody. It was pretty fun."
Dylan O'Brien,"I just really like fun, cool, interesting, quirky girls. And sometimes you find that in 6'2 model bodies and sometimes they're short and brunette. All shapes and sizes - it's really about the personality. That sounds cliche, but it's so freaking true!"
Syd Barrett,I think young people should have a lot of fun. But I never seem to have any.
Greg Kinnear,"There's times when I'll see a show, or something cooking on TV, and think, 'That can really be fun when it's working.' But it's a grind. I did that at NBC, it was five days a week. I was doing 'Talk Soup' and 'Later' at the same time. It's a hard job, more difficult than people realize."
LeToya Luckett,"As far as my personality, my friends and family know I'm crazy! I love to have fun; I'm bubbly. People say I'm funny but I don't know that I'm funny: I don't try to be funny and tell jokes and stuff like that, but I always got something slick to say."
Saina Nehwal,"Unlike most youngsters who have school as their 'second home' where they meet and make friends, for me playtime has been at the Gopichand Badminton Academy in Hyderabad.

Rick Nielsen,Playing it safe isn't fun; you have to take a chance.
Zach Galifianakis,"Comedians paint ourselves into corners all the time, and tastes in comedy change. The guy in 'The Hangover' was a really fun character to do, and it was easy to do.

Jane Birkin,"When you start recognising that you're having fun, life can be delightful."

ContraPoints,"I carry with me from my male upbringing a sense that femininity is forbidden. So when I appear on YouTube with forty butterflies glued to my body and glitter all over my face, I have a sense that I'm getting away with something I'm not supposed to. I'm being decadent. I'm enjoying a forbidden pleasure. And that's fun, and it's funny."
Nia Jax,"On 'Raw,' I'm more of a strong, silent type because I don't need to talk it up because I can back it up. But on 'Total Divas,' it's definitely different, because I'm unapologetically myself. I speak my mind, I'm goofy, and I like to have fun."

Astro,"It's always been fun for me to play somebody else. I did drama class when I was younger. It kind of just happened. I never said, 'I want to act.' I just auditioned for the role, I got it. I was blessed with this opportunity to be in 'Earth to Echo.' It's fun for me; it's cool to do."

Twiggy,Fashion should be stylish and fun.
Demba Ba,"My former agent introduced me to darts by saying it was a game that would be a lot of fun.

And it's the same in football, where I must strike the ball just to the right or left of a post."

Vanity,"Boy, it is not fun suffering in this body of weak flesh, but Jesus is straightening out all my crooked places."
Billy Gardell,"Everybody wants to be a better version of themselves - everybody. And I hope one day I can lose some weight. Maybe, who knows, I'll hire myself a trainer and a fancy cook.

Carla Hall,"What I love about 'The Chew' is that we have these celebrities come on, and you get to see them in a different light, cooking or enjoying food, when we usually don't see them in that setting.

Alexandra Daddario,"When you're with another actor who's also been through five hours of prosthetic makeup, and you're eating another person's neck, and fake blood is being spurted out at you for two minutes, it's incredibly fun, and you're in character for that time.

Mariah Carey,Christmas is always the most fun. I start looking forward to Christmas before it's even summertime.

Simone Biles,"A successful competition for me is always going out there and putting 100 percent into whatever I'm doing. It's not always winning. People, I think, mistake that it's just winning.

Ricky Gervais,"Everything I do is somehow rooted in humanity. It's always about people; it's always about ego. It's always about desperation. It's quite existential.

Simon Rex,"It was a lot of fun doing 'Felicity.' She had just won the Golden Globe, and she was huge at the time, but she was like the nicest girl ever. As a guest star on a show, you get on the set and you feel out of place, but she was so nice to me and really cool."
Pimp C,What's wrong with the 'Laffy Taffys' and the Soulja Boys? We need fun records. We gotta have dance music. We gotta have club music. We gotta have kids' music.
Camille Perri,"'When Katie Met Cassidy' is a romantic comedy about two very different women who find themselves uncontrollably drawn to one another. Issues of gender and sexuality play their part in the novel, but first and foremost, it's a fun, fast-paced love story."
Sam Mikulak,The most fun is the high bar - I just like the adrenaline rush of doing the high-flying releases.
Rodney Atkins,"The energy of college football rivals that of a live performance for me.

Karen Joy Fowler,"The smart way to build a literary career is you create an identifiable product, then reliably produce that product so people know what they are going to get. That's the smart way to build a career, but not the fun way. Maybe you can think about being less successful and happier. That's an option, too."
Saara Aalto,"This song is by Bjork called 'Oh So Quiet' and it's really different. I'll be screaming and just having fun on stage. It's really, really different but I'm very excited to do that number."
Jordin Sparks,"Well... I had braces and I had to wear headgear! I loved my braces, actually. For me, they were like a piece of jewelry! Instead of the silver or pewter I had gold braces. It was so much fun, I loved them. I got to change the colors and stuff and I had the rubber bands."
Tom Segura,"When you tour as much as I do, you're always on the road, and you tend to gravitate toward cities where you're like, 'Every time I'm in that city, the shows are fun.'"

Guy Martin,"Speed and danger don't always go together, but it's proper fun when they do."

George H. W. Bush,Old guys can still do fun things.

Kathy Reichs,Murder mysteries are puzzles that are fun to resolve.

John C. Reilly,"Movies are this thing that came into my life, and it still feels pretend in some way. I kind of do this thing, and I never really accepted this idea that I'm a film actor. That's what I do. I feel like I'm a theater actor that started doing films. Most people have never seen me in a play. They're fun, though."
Connor Franta,"I could Photoshop for hours. I spend way too much time making thumbnails. I spend, like, two hours on my thumbnails sometimes just because it's, like, fun."
Nick Lachey,"Part of the fun of kids is the craziness, and you've got to embrace that side of it as well."

Don McLean,"I developed this fantasy world. I found that that was much more fun and more interesting and exciting than real life was to me. Then, once I got the guitar going when I was a teenager, I set sail for the direction I've been in my whole life."

Michael Jordan,"I want people to understand, gambling is not a bad thing if you do it within the framework of what it's meant to be, which is fun and entertaining."
David Thewlis,"The thing about 'Harry Potter' is it's great fun because of the people - I was usually with Julie Walters and Mark Williams, Brendan Gleeson, Robbie Coltrane, and the kids. Wonderful, funny, amazing people. If you're going to hang around on a set bored, you might as well do it with Julie Walters."
Steve Carell,"When I first started looking at Twitter, I followed people like Steve Martin, who will just write the funniest non sequiturs now and then, which I thought was really fun. That's kind of the road I've taken. Every now and then, something comes into your mind and you put it out there. It's very innocuous. I think it's kind of fun."
Chloe Benjamin,"I wish I'd had more fun in college. I spent a lot of time in my dorm room, reading or writing while listening to my Sarah McLachlan Pandora station."
Taylour Paige,"When I was a Laker Girl, I only danced for three months. We did not get paid that much money, and I was working two jobs at the time.

Debbie Meyer,"I knew all these people had the same goals I did, but the one that worked the hardest would come out on top. That's what drove me all the time. But I had fun. I did better every day, and that's what made it fun."

Katharine Viner,"'Guardian' journalism itself will remain what it has always been: thoughtful, progressive, fiercely independent and challenging, and also witty, stylish, and fun."

Zach Ertz,Having success as a team is much more fun than having individual success. I have learned this lesson through the many wins I have experienced as a team.

Jennie Finch,"Right now in my career, it's like I'm having more fun than I've ever had, so it's kind of like, 'Man, I can't stop now.'"

Taylor Lautner,"I'm not the biggest motorcycle fan - they're cool and a lot of fun, but they're scary as well!"
Eddie Van Halen,"Obviously you have to have rhythm. If you have rhythm, then you can play anything you need. If you have rhythm and you love music, then play and play and play until you get to where you want to get. If you can pay the rent, great. If you can't, then you'd better be having fun."
Alex Guarnaschelli,"I exercise at a great gym and do dance classes mixed with some calisthenics. I really enjoy that because it reminds me of '80s aerobics. It's fun! I also bike ride, or sometimes I swim. Because I stand a lot, I don't really like to walk long distances. Running or jogging is out of the question."
Sabrina Bryan,"One of my favorite times of year is around Christmas when my entire family gets together and we make tamales together. It's a full two-day event, and we create an assembly line. It's awesome because everyone has his or her own part in making the dish. It's so much fun."
Emmanuelle Chriqui,I love doing voice-over. It's so fun.
Tony Khan,People ask me if I get nervous and I get a lot more nervous before a Jaguars or Fulham game. But I get more excited and have more fun at AEW than anything else.
Lucas Till,"I've kind of been in a video game, I've kind of been an action figure. It was actually a Barbie doll, so that's why I say kind of, but if I can get made fun of on 'South Park' or 'Family Guy,' then I'll know that I've done something good with my life."

Ted Cassidy,"I got to know the cast pretty well. Not so much Leonard Nimoy, I got to know William Shatner pretty well. They are a pretty good gang. The production company that made 'Star Trek' is the kind of production company that likes to have fun."
John Bercow,"If someone is being very cheeky, it can be quite fun to deal with that situation."
Richard Thaler,"As every successful parent learns, one way to encourage good behavior, from room-cleaning to tooth-brushing, is to make it fun. Not surprisingly, the same principle applies to adults. Adults like to have fun, too."

Robert Kazinsky,Being a kid is so much more fun than being an adult. I think that's the crux of it. I think men are just less inclined to grow up because it's much more fun being a child.
Talulah Riley,"My wide eyes make me look much younger without make-up, and although it's fun to have a line in innocence corrupted, I doubt I'll get to play the vampy vixen or a Hedda Gabler or Lady Macbeth."
Daniel Sharman,"I love playing really strung out characters, and characters that are really pushed to their limits and losing their mind. I think that's wonderful. To be able to lose it, in many ways, is just great fun to do."

Alex Lowe,The best climber in the world is the one that has the most fun.
Luke Combs,I do gravitate towards the sad songs because I find them to be more of a challenge for me from a writing perspective. There are things about those songs that do touch people in a way that a fun song can't.
Sam Rockwell,I used to break dance. I can do some good James Brown footwork. But now I think I've danced too much. My girlfriend made fun of me: 'Enough with the dancing.'

Anita Roddick,"When you run an entrepreneurial business, you have hurry sickness - you don't look back, you advance and consolidate. But it is such fun."
Dirk Nowitzki,"Off the floor, I'm really laid back: like, nothing really fazes me too much. But on the floor, I do get emotional and a little carried away. However, I started playing when I was 13 to have fun with my teammates, and that never stopped. I enjoy traveling and having fun in the locker room with the guys. Life is too short to be miserable."

Kristi Yamaguchi,I've had a lot more fun with the training.
Daniel Bryan,Being a bad guy is fun for me.

Rachael Ray,"I'm not a chef. I haven't created any new technique in the kitchen. I'm not a rocket scientist. I think I'm good at writing accessible, fun, and affordable meals for the average American family. That's what I think I'm good at."
Jeff Bridges,My website's kind of fun for me. I get to do drawings on that. It's kind of fun.
Scott Caan,"To me, theater is the mecca; if you really love to act, that's where it's the most fun, by a long shot."
Jane Birkin,"There's no fun in a bag if it's not kicked around so that it looks as if the cat's been sitting on it - and it usually has. The cat may even be in it! I always put on stickers and beads and worry beads. You can get them from Greece, Israel, Palestine - from anywhere in the world."
Tom Ellis,Lucifer has a sense of fun about life; he just likes to play with people. But the sense of humor of the show is what makes the show entertaining as opposed to dark.

Lars Ulrich,"If there was no Black Sabbath, I could still possibly be a morning newspaper delivery boy. No fun."
Jeremy Irons,"I looked at the circus, and I looked at the carnival, at the fun fair. But I looked at sleeping accommodations and decided I was too middle class to put up with that!

Steve Aoki,"The haters and the trolls have always used me as an excuse to make fun of something that is out of the ordinary, something that doesn't necessarily make sense to them. For whatever reason, I have always been a target that people love to attack."
James Veitch,"Don't get me wrong - I don't want to be mean to the scammers. There are lots of people online who do that. I'm content merely having fun inventing, and I figure any time they're spending with me is time in which they're not scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings."
Alanis Morissette,"Alpha men are very turned on by the alpha woman, really high chemistry, really fun to work with, probably really fun to have affairs with, but there's not sustainable harmony in that lack of complement. There can only be one person in the driver's seat."
Betsy Hodges,"Done right, precision can help clarify, plus it's fun."
Granit Xhaka,"Here in the Premier League, you have to give 100 per cent for the whole 90 minutes. It's not like after 70 minutes you can say, 'We're 2-0 up, so let's have some fun now' - that doesn't happen in the Premier League."
Paul Dini,"Batman is pretty much a self-trained guy. I think it would be fun to do a character like Superman or Captain Marvel or maybe Green Lantern, somebody who's got a completely different resource for fighting crime and fighting villains."
Steve Buscemi,"I've never had a grand plan. I've only just tried to keep open to many different possibilities, have fun and work with people who are passionate about what they do."

Alec Baldwin,Acting in the theatre is fun; acting in film is work.
Ronda Rousey,"I make fractals. They're like mathematical pictures. My stepdad is actually a rocket scientist, so in his free time, he gave me a fractal program for fun. He showed me how to use it when I was about nine or 10, and I made thousands of fractals."
Naomi Osaka,"I think, for me, I just really want to have fun with every match that I play because tennis is a game."

Elsa Schiaparelli,"I think it is childish for men to joke about women's clothes, to make fun of our hats, to complain over the cost of a good fur coat."
Kesha,"I am so not a proper, good female. I can't dance in high heels and I'm just so not girly, but then I see these men with these banging bodies, dancing in heels, singing, and having so much fun with so much make-up on. That makes me honestly want to be a better woman."

Don Cheadle,"The fun for me is to mix it all up. I would actually like to do something as far away from what I've just done, just for my own personal joy and growth, for what I want to do."
Kate Middleton,"When I first visited the Hospice in Milton, I had a pre-conceived idea as to what to expect. Far from being a clinical, depressing place for sick children, it was a home. Most importantly, it was a family home, a happy place of stability, support and care. It was a place of fun."
Christopher Poole,"As a teenager, I used to use the nickname 'Moo' as a moniker online, and then I turned into 'Moot' for fun, which I didn't even realize was a real word at the time, and it just stuck with me."
Anthony Mackie,"I did this movie with Spike Lee called 'Sucker Free City,' and that would have to be my favorite role by far. It was just so much fun to work with Spike and shoot in San Francisco."
Jill Soloway,"Your first job, I tell people I mentor, is managing your affect. Be nice and say nice things. Make it so that the people walk away from interacting with you and say, 'That was fun.' That will make them want to come back and do it again."
Molly Ivins,"Havin' fun while freedom fightin' must be one of those lunatic Texas traits we get from the water - which is known to have lithium in it - because it goes all the way back to Sam Houston, surely the most lovable, the most human, and the funniest of all the great men this country has ever produced."
Mary Wilson Little,There is no pleasure in having nothing to do; the fun is in having lots to do and not doing it.
Lynda Carter,"I sang in bands as a kid. In high school, I was already on the road doing a single. And that's no fun. Then came 'Wonder Woman' and children."
Sebastian Thrun,"Education should learn from the positive side of gaming - reward, accomplishment, and fun."

Sunny Singh,We really love decorating the Christmas tree around Christmas and have our little fun by playing Secret Santa.
Paul Allen,"Part of life has to be about enjoying life and having different experiences, especially if you're with friends and you're on an adventure on a boat or a submarine - it's a lot of fun."
Gary Paulsen,"I don't have a favorite author; I have favorite books. 'Moby Dick' is a favorite book, but Melville was a drunk who beat his wife. 'Moveable Feast' by Hemingway, but I would not like him personally. He was a stupid macho person who believed in shooting animals for fun, but that book was incredible!"
Ian Anthony Dale,"A lot of the time, a moral compass is all that separates a hero from being a villain; otherwise, the two are very much the same. Both are generally the richest and most complex characters, and they get to have all the fun. I guess it's those types of roles that I ultimately gravitate towards."
Kyle Kuzma,"I don't go to malls. I've just always been a simple person. I hang out, work out. That's what I think is fun."

Rebecca Black,"'Friday' is about hanging out with friends, having fun. I felt like it was my personality in that song."

My son, as much as I love to get away from the game, he really does love basketball. He just wants to shoot on this little hoop I got him. It's just awesome to see them smile all the time."
Tom Douglas,"It's really fun to have a convection oven, even it if it's a little convection toaster oven. It really changes the way you bake."
Ryan Sheckler,"I don't really have a type. I just kind of hang out with girls that I think have a good personality, know how to have fun, active and definitely have something going on in their life so they are busy so I'm not stuck all the time hanging out."
Ken Follett,"The research is the easiest. The outline is the most fun. The first draft is the hardest, because every word of the outline has to be fleshed out. The rewrite is very satisfying."
Carine Roitfeld,"I'm still like a butterfly going from one job to another job. But it's quite lovely - I hope to keep this freedom, to have fun."
Alex Hirsch,"A lot of the fun of 'Gravity Falls' comes from the secrecy surrounding the plot. We want fans to be able to guess and speculate, to be surprised by twists and be engaged when they get things right."
Paris Jackson,"You can be, like, a totally different person on camera, and it's fun. You can take on another character, and it's awesome."
Ashley Roberts,"I like to mix influences from different eras, like maybe '70s bell-bottoms, something fun from the '80s, or a bit of '90s grunge."
Brandon Flowers,"People misinterpret my emotions towards Nirvana because I've said things about how something happened with grunge that took a little bit of fun out of things. It's no offense to Nirvana; they were one of the greats, obviously. But something died there, too, and we haven't quite gotten the groove back."
Kriti Sanon,Sudheer Varma is very easy going and very confident director. He knows exactly what he wants. He has a very good vision and knows how many shots he wants for a scene. He is super fast. He gives freedom for actors to try different things. The atmosphere on the sets was never serious. We had great fun working together.
Feist,"So, I'm on 'Sesame Street,' walking around with all these monsters, Elmo and his buddies, a whole bunch of chickens, a whole bunch of penguins and a number four dancing about. It was just pure joy, simple, ridiculous fun, stupid joy. There's no irony. 'Sesame Street' is just a crazy great place to be."
Marsai Martin,I usually go home and go to sleep; that's what I do for fun.
Kirstin Maldonado,A miserable karaoke experience is when people are trying really hard and trying to show off. You have to just be chill - that's what makes karaoke fun.
Estella Warren,"It's hard to go with a trend. As soon as it's out, everyone picks it up. It's important to stay true to yourself. Have fun with fashion instead of letting it dictate."
Alma Guillermoprieto,"I love food and I love everything involved with food. I love the fun of it. I love restaurants. I love cooking, although I don't cook very much. I love kitchens."

Jim Gaffigan,"There's something that's really fun about the challenge of making the mundane funny, too, I think."
Nancy Horan,"So this was the big secret historians keep to themselves: historical research is wildly seductive and fun. There's a thrill in the process of digging, then piecing together details like a puzzle."
John Green,"When you're writing a novel, you spend four years sitting in your basement and a year waiting for the book to come out and then you get the feedback. When you do work online, the moment you're finished making it, people start responding to it which is really fun and allows for a kind of community development you just can't have in novels."
Kyler Murray,"Christmas time, you're at home with your friends and your parents. You sit down around the table and just play Scrabble. It's a fun game for me."
Serinda Swan,"I pole-dance. I do. I do it at an aerobics center. Having done gymnastics for 13 years, I find it's one of the only things where I can still use my core and all my muscles. Plus, it's fun: You're a girl, and you get to dance around a pole!"
Antonio Brown,"Anytime you get an opportunity to put more fun into the game, that's good. I've got a lot of positive energy."
Taika Waititi,"Shooting a movie should be fun! It's not a real job. It can be hard, but at the end of the day, we're dressing up and playing pretend."
Guru Randhawa,Punjabi songs are fun. They help to cheer up the environment and the mood.
Canelo Alvarez,"I was made fun of at a young age. I would fight a lot in the streets, and it has a lot to do with the way I am today. It helped my development as a fighter, but what can I say?"
Alexandra Petri,"Being a person of faith is just another of a wide range of fun activities available to those who come to Harvard. When Harvard boasts to admitted students of its more than 40 religious groups, it does so in the same vein that it boasts of its nearly dozen a cappella groups."
Lucas Neff,"That honeymoon phase is so much fun in real life, when you meet and discover somebody new and fall in love and chase them. The pursuit. And that climactic final moment of ultimate togetherness."
Blake Lively,"I wear a lot more glitter around the holidays, so I'm always wearing different glitter nail polish or fun metallic eye shadow. It's the holidays - everything is more twinkly and celebratory."
Eddie Guerrero,"The twenty minutes or more we spend inside the ring, that's the fun part. It's the rest of our lives that's the real battle - the ruthless backstage politics, the constant traveling, the endless mental and physical aches and pains."
John Cleese,"Now most people do not want an ordinary life in which they do a job well, earn the respect of their collaborators and competitors, bring up a family and have friends. That's not enough any more, and I think that is absolutely tragic - and I'm not exaggerating - that people feel like a decent, ordinary, fun life is no longer enough."
Giada De Laurentiis,The holidays stress people out so much. I suggest you keep it simple and try to have as much fun as you can.
Miranda Hart,"I wanted to be a farmer's wife. I thought it would be quite fun to wake up of a morning, collect eggs and have sheep and pigs as pets. I know now that it would also involve having to sleep with the farmer, but at the time I wasn't thinking about the sexual implications - I was 11."
Becki Newton,Glamour is fun! Spending time to get ready isn't about being fussy; it's about taking care of myself.
Don Tapscott,Don't have work-life balance - at least in the sense of trying to escape from work so you can have a life. Work should be fun - so make work enjoyable and satisfying for everyone - among other reasons because it pays off.
Kelsey Chow,"It's fun to get away from myself for a while when I take on these roles that have very different personalities from my own. I get to say things I normally wouldn't say or act in ways I normally wouldn't act. After all, such roles are more challenging because you really have to immerse yourself in the character."
Charles Woodson,"Father Time is definitely undefeated, that's for sure. But does it feel good to have some people eat their words about what they said about me as a player? Yeah, that's fun."
Malcolm Forbes,It's more fun to arrive a conclusion than to justify it.
Nina Dobrev,"Part of life and part of the enjoyment of life is a croissant and a chocolate cake and eggs and milkshakes and oatmeal. There's so many things, you have to learn to appreciate it all. When I don't eat as much as I should, I'm not fun to be around; I'm fussy."
Sheldon Lee Glashow,"Chemistry is good for fun - it's like baseball. It has its role for small children, but I can't see an adult being concerned with it."
Michael Carbonaro,"A lot of people have experimented with hidden cameras and magic before. What I do, which I think is different from any other style of prank or hidden camera, is that it's all fun. It's back to that kind of fun that 'Candid Camera' was. It's not mean-spirited at all. It's a joyful kind of play with people."
Al Feldstein,"I used to say, 'Mad' takes on both sides.' We even used to rake the hippies over the coals. They were protesting the Vietnam War, but we took aspects of their culture and had fun with it. 'Mad' was wide open."
Peter James,"There are people who can achieve huge success in life, while adding a bit of fun and a splash of colour to this increasingly grey world."
Ranveer Brar,"Food should flirt with the palette. If the food doesn't flirt with your palette, then it's not fun enough."
Fortune Feimster,"People know who I am or are fans of 'Chelsea Lately,' and that makes my shows more fun. People know I'm silly and are on board with what I'm bringing to the table. I see the boyfriends who got dragged to the show by their girlfriends, and by the end, they're laughing harder than anybody. That's the best feeling: 'I knew I was going to get you.'"
John Grisham,"Twenty years on, the books are still fun to write and I've still got lots of stories I want to tell, mainly about social injustice and people chewed up by the system."
Donovan Mitchell,"People make fun of Utah nightlife, but it's actually dope. I love it."
Dick Van Dyke,"The years have been just full of surprises for me, and a lot of fun."
India de Beaufort,"School was rough for me. I was a good student in middle school, but high school wasn't so fun. I still pulled through, though! I excelled in art, fashion, history and English literature - anything creative. Math and science I struggled a bit more in."
Tom Hardy,"Fame and stuff like that is all very cool, but at the end of the day, we're all human beings. Although what I do is incredibly surreal and fun and amazing and I'm really grateful for it, I don't believe my own press release, do you know what I mean?"
Lindsey Horan,"Covid time was not a fun time, I'll say that much. There was probably a week and a half there that was pretty miserable. And obviously I wouldn't want anyone to have to go through that."
Mark Duplass,"When you're improvising, it's fun to find something that you can lean on that is similar to your life experience. In my opinion, that's very helpful."
Sasheer Zamata,"I just followed the fun. I just followed the things I was really interested in, and it turned out to be what I needed to do."
Akiva Schaffer,"'The Watch' is first and foremost a comedy, but since I got to shoot the film using elements from the sci-fi genre, I wanted to make sure the alien didn't look goofy. I got to make a real alien that looks dangerous. That was a big plus for me because I got to do something really fun and cool."
Frederica Mathewes-Green,"Somehow we just don't make the same boisterous fun of Holy Week that we do of Christmas. No one plans to have a holly, jolly Easter."
James Cromwell,'Barney Miller' was a lot of fun. I'm very fond of Abe Vigoda. Most - a lot of people on that cast - I really liked.
Carson Wentz,"I listen to worship music before the game to calm my nerves and just go out and have fun. It's a game, and I try to enjoy it."
Benjamin Cohen,"And although I like to relax and have fun, my passion is my work."
William Morris Hunt,"There's lots of fun in this world, after all. And if there isn't, there is in the next. And we're going there, sure."
Alejandro Jodorowsky,I like Hollywood movies. I like them like I like to eat scrambled eggs; I like them for fun.
Nina Dobrev,"I've reached a point where I'm comfortable in my own skin, and I do what I need to do, to feel good, but I'm built the way I am. The dancer's feet, the bruises on my legs, they're not going to go away. I think real girls have bruises. Tough chicks get bruised. They get dirty. And they have fun."
Tye Sheridan,"When I was shooting 'Mud,' every day was my favourite! I had so much fun on this film and loved working with all the cast and crew! It was a great experience."
Dean Devlin,"There are three things that I'm addicted to when it comes to entertainment. In no particular order, One, I'm addicted to the cheer moment. 'Librarians' has plenty of them. Next, I feel that life is hard, and I want my entertainment fun, and 'Librarians' is fun as a Christmas party. And third, I like to be moved."
Tracie Peterson,"I've actually traveled quite a bit with various authors. Judith Miller and I toured the highlands in Scotland with Liz Curtis Higgs, and that was incredible fun. However, I love going with my husband, who - although he is not a writer per se, he is a historian and can give me a lot of insight on various historical locations."
Aldis Hodge,"As far as playing different characters within the character, I think that's fun. Very rarely, on TV, do you get to do that on such a regular basis."
Carol Burnett,"I very much enjoyed doing 'Law & Order,' playing a killer - that was fun, and they had a family feel around the set, so it was a happy show to do even though the subject matter was quite the opposite."
Henry Winkler,"I always catch and release and don't even eat trout. I think they are so majestic. I won't eat a trout even in a restaurant. They are beautiful and so much fun, and they give me such joy to catch them that it is my pleasure to take a picture with them, give them a kiss, sign a laminated autographed picture and put it in their mouth."
Brandon Ingram,It was fun getting my feet wet on an NBA floor.
Paul Di Filippo,"Steampunk, the repurposing of Victorian culture and technology for contemporary fun and profit, is so ubiquitous - in media, books, fashion, music, cosplay, and maker culture - that we tend to imagine its superficial aspects are all that define it."
Lecrae,"When I hung out with my Uncle Chris, things got real. He was fun, talkative, and loud. He was the life of the party and a magnet for mischief. Since he saw the world through a gangsta's lens, he wanted me to become tough and aggressive."
Yvonne Orji,"I grew up in a place called Port Harcourt, Nigeria, the youngest of four. What I remember most about Nigeria was the ease. I would play by the pool, have fun with friends."
Dion Waiters,I'm a fun person to be around.
Matthew McConaughey,"Any artist, the work you do, if it's a painting or if it's a performance, you hope it translates to a common denominator with the people that they see something in their own life in there. Or they see something in somebody else's life. That's what's fun about sharing art."
Lewis Grizzard,"'Redneck' has been terribly abused as a term. Where I come from, a redneck was a farmer who worked the fields all day and got his neck sunburned. People made fun of them."
Gregg Wallace,"Picnics enable you to be outside, eat fun finger-food and enjoy that greatest of pastimes: People-watching."
Missy Elliott,"A lot of people don't know that before the artist, I wanted to be a writer and producer. That's always been a love of mine. Its easy for me to do it on myself, but it's fun to create for someone else."
Darby Stanchfield,"Kerry Washington is the most fun: she cracks me up! Everyone talks about how drop-dead gorgeous, smart, and fashionable she is, and she is all of that, but I must add she's the hugest goofball. She has the best sense of humor and lightheartedness that makes coming into work every day so delightful."
Garry Marshall,"I am a total believer of making the process a good time - make it memorable, have some fun, try to shoot high in your quality and then don't get crazy, see what happens."
Hilary Rhoda,I've never had a specific style philosophy. I wear what I know works on me and I'll play around with accessories or some other fun additions for the outfit.
Adrian Grenier,"Because when you go out, and you have fun, basically you're performing for these tabloid outlets and the paparazzi. And when you perform and create this story, they're chuffed - they get excited, they capture it, and they put it out."
Christian Siriano,"Shoes are a big part of your look. I think that if your outfit isn't really something special, then fun footwear is a great way to jazz it up and make your ensemble more interesting."
Mike Myers,"And I thought, when I have kids, that's the sort of well told, silly, and fun fairy tale that I would want to take them to. But it was an amazing experience. And I think Shrek is a real classic, a fairy tale classic."
Peter Higgs,"I'm a great admirer of 'The Simpsons.' It's very surprising because it's backed by a right-wing television company in the U.S., and quite often it's poking fun at the people who would be its audience."
Jonathan Franklin,"Getting to Valle Nevado is half the fun. A serpentine road from Santiago wriggles up the spine of Andean peak for an hour, then traverses a valley and finally up again. The hotel is perched on a rugged mountain crag at 3,000m: no other sign of human development is visible from this spot, which is close to the Argentinean border."
Drew Goddard,"I tend to fall more into the fun horror genre than the traumatic horror genre. I love the films where you're laughing as much as screaming, but that doesn't mean I don't like the other ones."
Michael Moschen,"Now, juggling can be a lot of fun; play with skill and play with space, play with rhythm."
Jason Sudeikis,It's fun to play the type of people you dislike.
Mardy Fish,The truth is you want stress in your life. You don't want an actual anxiety-free life. What would the fun be there?
Jana Kramer,I would love to do a duet with Tim McGraw. I think that would be fun.
Rachel Hunter,"It was all about flying round the world, working hard, being on the cover of Vogue, making money. It wasn't fun. It was exhausting, but I was young and convinced I knew best."
Kid Rock,There's no way anyone in the world is having more fun than I am. I truly believe that.
Mike Gallagher,"When you get John McCain going about the war against terror, he comes alive. That's when it gets fun. He rattles off the statistics, he showcases his wealth of military experience, and he doesn't recognize the concepts of defeat or surrender."
Lauren Graham,"My time at Barnard was fun but stressful. I transferred there from the acting conservatory at NYU, and my Rolling Around On the Floor Pretending to Be a Lion classes didn't translate into many academic credits."
Ray Liotta,"Acting is playing pretend, playing a children's game at an adult level, but with children's rules. It's fun to play bad guys. I've never been in a fight in my life, so it's fun to play something that's different."
Essie Davis,"'The Custodian' was my first film, and there were so many lessons to learn in that week. It was really fun, but for me, I look at it as a training film, and I'm not really proud of my work in it."
Tasha Smith,"I'm a black woman who loves hair. I enjoy changing my hair, having fun with it - just hair! I go from braids, to weaves, to wigs, to natural hair."
Johnny Gargano,"Johnny Wrestling, to me, isn't just a cool nickname or a fun thing for the crowd to chant. To me, it's a state of mind, and it's just who I am. I first stepped foot in a wrestling ring when I was 8 years old."
Dick Van Dyke,"I've been talking about retiring for years. It's my standard answer to the question, 'What are your future plans?' The truth is, I'll always want to do things that are worthwhile or fun."
James Bay,Being exhausted is all part of the fun. I'm cool with it. I'm not going to wish that it would slow down.
Maureen Dowd,"I feel like I owe it to the readers to try to pull back the veil and give them the honest version of what's going on. But it's not more fun. If Obama, as he does sometimes already, gets a little snippy with me about something I've written, you're thinking, 'Oh God, the president of the United States is already annoyed with me.'"
John Lithgow,"I'm a fun father, but not a good father. The hard decisions always went to my wife."
Steven Crowder,"Sadly, marriage has become a punchline in today's society. From referring to the wife as 'the old ball and chain' to nearly every poorly written sitcom that we watch, the message we're sending to today's generation is clear... Marriage = no fun."
Mike Krzyzewski,Fun is to experience things you would not have been able to experience in any other setting.
Christie Hefner,"My father has always enjoyed games... always with a combination of the fun and social side of it, but also always highly competitive."
Philip Roth,People are unjust to anger - it can be enlivening and a lot of fun.
Emma Watson,"I don't have makeup on all the time, but when I want, I have fun with my friends choosing clothes and putting nail polish on."
Adam Neumann,"When I started at Baruch in January 2002, I was almost 23 years old. I'd previously spent five years as an officer the Israeli Navy. I did what I thought you were supposed to do at that age - a little studying and a lot of trying to have fun."
Jim Harrison,The old fun thing is when somebody typed up the first chapter of War and Peace. And then made a precis of the rest of it and sent it out and only one publisher recognized it.
Ivanka Trump,"Instagram is my favorite! It's interactive and a fun way to stay connected to my friends, family and fans. I love posting photos from family trips, property visits, previews of my collections, everything!"
Dwayne Johnson,"My philosophy is, it's always very rewarding when you can make an audience laugh. I don't mind making fun of myself. I like self-deprecating comedy. But I'd like you to laugh with me occasionally, too."
Kendall Jenner,Every girl loves posing in her underwear. It's always fun to do that.
Sid Meier,Our approach to making games is to find the fun first and then use the technology to enhance the fun.
Alessandra Ambrosio,"And my daughter really likes Justin Bieber, so I think she'll have fun watching him. But I think Rihanna is the perfect match for the Victoria's Secret show because she's really beautiful, she's really sexy, and she's really talented."
Michael Smith,"In 1986, I was asked by the then-Dean of Science at the University of British Columbia, Dr. R.C. Miller, Jr., to establish a new interdisciplinary institute, the Biotechnology Laboratory. I decided that it was time for me to start paying back for the thirty years of fun that I had been able to have in research."
Jane Krakowski,"My parents were involved in community theater in New Jersey. Instead of hiring a baby sitter, they would take me with them. So my love of acting seeped in from watching my parents and seeing them having fun."
Bode Miller,"We should tell our kids to just have fun, participate and not get bent on winning or losing. But every coach, when they say that, they say it tongue in cheek, 'Don't worry about winning': If you win I'll get you ice cream, but if you lose I'm going to pout in the car."
Terry Funk,"In ECW, hardcore wrestling wasn't done just for the fun of it. It was done for a purpose, for a reason. And for me, it was done to exist and produce a revenue for my family."
Holly Holm,"When I don't have a fight scheduled, training is even more fun. I can come into the gym and work on stuff that isn't generated for a specific game plan. I can just play around with it and have a good time. I never want to get to the point where I'm sick of it."
Steven Gundry,"Nothing is worse than washing a head of lettuce or greens, then trying to blot the water with paper towels. A salad spinner lets you rinse, then spin all the water off completely. Plus, it's fun to use."
Jurnee Smollett-Bell,I started shooting 'The Defenders' two days after I wrapped' Friday Night Lights.' I was doing research for 'The Defenders' throughout - interviewing lawyers and sitting in courtrooms just to watch - but there's something fun about throwing yourself in the water and learning by doing.
Tom Douglas,"Often we eat squid fried, so it's fun to grill it for a change. To grill squid, slice the cleaned bodies open into two flat pieces and thread them, along with the tentacles, onto skewers, then grill quickly over a direct fire with the coals as close as possible to the grate, turning the squid several times."
Nicole Kidman,"I would describe myself as emotional and highly strung. If something upsets me, it really upsets me. If something makes me angry, I get really angry. But it's all very upfront. I can't hide it. I'm also loyal and I hope I'm fun."
Austin Seferian-Jenkins,"I'm me: I'm a fun, easy-going guy that likes to work hard, who's very driven and determined."
Adam McKay,There's nothing more fun than making fun of what's sacred.
Thomas Newman,"The fun for me musically is that you never quite know what works and why. So why pretend you do? Why not just put things together and discover, in the creative process, if and why they work? That approach has served me well."
James Cagney,"I got a part as a chorus girl in a show called Every Sailor and I had fun doing it. Mother didn't really approve of it, through."
Jrue Holiday,Guarding Kevin Durant - that's fun for me.
Chris Squire,"'Drama' was put together quickly; there were a lot of intense, 16-hour days. Despite the pressure, it was a lot of fun, and the end result was an album I'm very proud of."
James Blunt,We are in the entertainment business. This should be fun. We are musicians; we don't save lives. We shouldn't... we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously or be revered that much.
Woody Hayes,The bowl games are only supposed to be a fun reward.
Gene Tierney,"I dated dozens of young men, had fun with all, made commitments to none."
Lita Ford,"But duets are a lot of fun, I'd love to do another one."
Aaron Lazar,"I went to the opening of 'Sister Act,' and I had such a great time. I had no idea what it was about, and I had never seen the movies. But I heard the show went through some major last-minute craziness in previews, and man, opening night was really fun and really entertaining."
Wes Ball,"I always wanted to do a very fun, adventurous kind of car chase, and the opening of 'Ruin' is essentially like the 'Star Wars' trench run."
Laurie David,"It's easy to get good table talk going if you have a little help in the form of questions, games, newspaper articles, books with fun statistics, things like that."
Bobby Orr,"Minor sports in the community is fun and recreation for everyone, not just the elite. I think back to my days in minor hockey and those are my fondest memories, having fun."
Tommy Ramone,"It was never fun being in the Ramones, which is the saddest thing of all, cause it shoulda been fun. It was probably fun when we played Performance Studio, and maybe some of the early gigs at CBGB's. But the Ramones were the type of group that had a bizarre mindset. Being in the band was so cut off from reality."
Bill Griffith,Are we having fun yet?
Alvin Lee,"I've always been much more of a guitar picker, but I began to feel forced into a position of being the epitome of a rock & roll guitarist. Originally, TYA wanted to make it without having to compromise to pop. It worked for a while, but after five or six years, the fun went out of it for me; a lot of the music went out of it."
Missy Elliott,"It feels different.... When hip-hop was beginning for me, people weren't making the kind of money that they make now. It was for the love of doing it and having fun with it."
Thom Filicia,Mean people are no fun.
Kim Petras,"I love Bob Marley so much. Honestly, all of Madonna's discography. She has so many amazing, fun songs. Or Cyndi Lauper. The thing is, at the same time, I also love listening to Lana Del Rey all the time, the saddest thing you can do to yourself."
Lil Yachty,"I'm half-and-half on school. I had fun in grade school, but when I went to college, it was the worst place I've ever been in my entire life."
Elton John,"I do like Britney Spears. I think she's cute. I think she's fun. And I like her records. You know, I'm not a pop snob whatsoever. I think she makes great pop records."
Alex Borstein,Television and film acting is really fun because you are working with other people and you are not completely responsible for the outcome of the project.
Kawhi Leonard,"It's definitely fun when you're able to translate your practice into the game. It's fun, and you know that your hard work paid off."
Mads Mikkelsen,"I don't necessarily prefer playing villains. I know a lot of people say they are more fun, but if the scriptwriter has done their work well, you can find something realistic in a villain and find the mistakes in a hero - it's all down to the writing."
Ashley Nell Tipton,It was really important for me to create fun and trendy pieces for the plus-size market.
Bill Skarsgard,I worked with Lady Gaga for a day on a video shoot. It was crazy; we had a lot of fun. I had a great time.
Jillian Hervey,"I love a lot of the '70s singers: Pam Grier from the 'Foxy Brown' movie, Diana Ross, Tina Turner. They've always been able to embrace their hair, and they've never been afraid to take risks and go all out and make it thick and fun and a statement at the same time."
Todd Gitlin,"Like Americans, people outside America want fun, want an emotional compensation for the utilitarianism and calculation that mark the rest of their lives."

Reba McEntire,"I use all my skills that I can muster up, but the fun thing is that I find some untapped skills every once in a while. I get that from my daddy."
Akshaye Khanna,Being single has its own advantages and it's a fun thing.
Tobias Forge,"I'm a big fan of a lot of prog music. As a record collector as well, I won't throw anybody or any band under the bus, but a lot of the records are fun to collect, are not necessarily very good. There are a lot of prog bands out there that it's a really cool record, but it's, like, not really there."
Bez,"I'm getting on a bit, don't know what I'm going to do, no pension pot and the prospect of growing old in the city, well... So I met these people a few years ago doing community type of living, land sharing, living in a community way. You can live on next to nothing. It's about living the social life but keeping the party going and have a bit of fun."
Melanie Martinez,"Growing up, I always took things too personal and was very emotional, and I got made fun of for it."
Zooey Deschanel,"I always choose roles that are, you know, hopefully different from the last role. I don't wanna do the same thing over and over again because that's, well, first of all that's no fun."
Jillian Michaels,"Make 80 percent of the food you eat healthy, then take 20 percent of your daily calories and make them fun."
Carmella,"When I was in NXT, I never wrestled on a TakeOver. I didn't have too many high-profile matches: I probably wrestled about 10 matches in total on NXT TV, including the one championship match against Bayley, which was so much fun and my favorite match in NXT."
Carrie Brownstein,"At its core, kitsch feels like something less than art; it panders to the middle and is flagrantly anti-art, though it often apes or references art. This referential, ersatz quality is why it's so fun to collect."
Ronda Rousey,"When I was in school, martial arts made you a dork, and I became self-conscious that I was too masculine. I was a 16-year-old girl with ringworm and cauliflower ears. People made fun of my arms and called me 'Miss Man.' It wasn't until I got older that I realized: These people are idiots. I'm fabulous."
Fatima Sana Shaikh,"Although I started off as a child artist, I left acting in between, as I felt that I was missing the fun of school days. But a little later, I became keen on acting again and started going for auditions."
John Malkovich,"Well, I like to have fun at work."
Shawn Bradley,"I have had a very fun, positive experience in seminary. It's taught me a lot."
Christopher Guest,"The fun part about doing our movies is that you're creating something using the talents of people rather than finding these pathetic people who are thrust into these situations. That, to me, is completely artless."
Ruth Porat,I stayed at Morgan Stanley for 27 years because it was fun. I kept learning.
John Cassavetes,"There is no reason why a serious film, one about life, can't be enjoyable, maybe even fun. Emotions can be very entertaining, you know. I try to use them generously in my films."
Giancarlo Stanton,"Yeah, I'm financially good for the rest of my life - great. But I'm not trying to come here, get my butt kicked for 10 years, and go home to a lavish lifestyle. That's not fun for me."
Adam McKay,Nothing is more enjoyable for me than when I'm watching a movie or a TV show and there's that sense that anything can happen. It is the most fun feeling in the world.
Carl Honore,"'In Praise of Slowness' chronicles the global trend towards deceleration that has come to be known as the Slow Movement. Don't worry, though: it is not a Luddite rant. I love speed. Going fast can be fun, liberating and productive. The problem is that our hunger for speed, for cramming more and more into less and less time, has gone too far."
Paul Krugman,I admit it: I had fun watching right-wingers go wild as health reform finally became law.
Charlie Puth,"I don't love the whole Hollywood mentality, but I do love the weather and how motivated everyone is around here. It motivates me to make fun music."
Mackenzie Astin,"I technically have two last names, which is a lot of fun when you're making airline reservations."
Michelle Obama,"I tried to be a serious student and not procrastinate, but I was still somebody that would be described as somebody who liked to have fun, too, and go to the occasional party - or two or three."
Charles Dance,"I had a stammer through adolescence. Any fun I'd had performing in school plays disappeared and only came back at 18, when the stammer started to go. Then I thought: 'Well, perhaps I can show off now.'"
Carrie Ann Inaba,I love fresh fruit and vegetables. I'm not a strict dieter. I don't think that anything in life should be so regimented that you're not having fun or can't enjoy like everybody else. Just know that fresh food is always going to be better for you.
Harvey Ball,There are two ways to go about it. You can take a compass and draw a perfect circle and make two perfect eyes as neat as can be. Or you can do it freehand and have some fun with it. Like I did. Give it character.
Prabhu Deva,It's fun matching steps with younger actors. It gives me the confidence to keep going.
Alice Cooper,"That's like making fun of a maniac because his brain isn't completely right, because he isn't in the norm."
Jake Tapper,It is empirically indecent to make fun of the disabled... That's just indecent.
Ashton Kutcher,"The truth is that I'm an idiot. I am. I don't do things by the rules sometimes. I say things that I probably shouldn't say. I push buttons. I deserve to be made fun of. And I feel like, as soon as you can make fun of something, it instantly removes the fear."
James Denton,"It slows down grocery shopping, because so many women at the store watch the show. I always end up talking to two or three people every time I go to Ralphs. It's fun."
Nina Garcia,"Style is about fun. True style is not about having a closet full of expensive and beautiful things - it is instead about knowing when, where, and how to utilize your collection."
Charles Barkley,Golf is fun - until you hit somebody in the head.
Tina Fey,"The only way I could get comfortable around people was to make them laugh. I was an obedient girl, and humor was my one form of rebellion. I used comedy to deflect. Like, 'Hey, check out my zit!' - you know, making fun of yourself before someone else has a chance to."
Aaron Judge,"In my early work, my time in the batting cage, that's serious, and that's when I feel like I'm really working. That's where I have to lock in on my approach, make sure my mechanics are right, and make sure my mindset is right for the upcoming game. But then, when the game comes up, it's a game! You're supposed to have fun when you play games."
Joe Wicks,"I want mums and dads to get up together and train with the kids, exercise, have fun together and connect through fitness."
Kevin Nealon,"I think there's a part of me that might be my alter ago, like the carefree, do-what-he-wants kind of guy, because I've been so restrained most of my life, going to Catholic school and being the good son and the good husband. It's a fun escape route for me sometimes to lead that life."
Paula Abdul,I will never forget my humble beginnings as a Laker Girl. It was probably one of the most fun jobs I ever had.
Christian Eriksen,It's never fun to be injured; it's always boring being on the side. You want to go back to help the team and to be able to play.
Siddharth Shukla,"I am not a dancer and for me, to learn the art is fun. It gives you the confidence that you can dance."
Jo Koy,"There's nothing more fun than seeing the things that you dreamed about when you were a kid come true. I'm headlining an iconic theater in New York City during the New York Comedy Festival. When you're starting off as a comedian, you don't think that's ever going to happen."
Lily Collins,I think it's important to figure out you and to have fun and to be dating and to figure out what you like and what you don't like. It's what growing up is all about.
Leslie Mann,It's always fun to think about winning an award. I thought about winning awards when I was a little girl. Everybody wants to win an award for something.
Scott Hall,"The NWO, yeah, we're a bunch of outlaws, thugs, whatever you want to call us, but... we do what we want, when we want. And we're having fun doing it."
John Lithgow,"I'm as vain as the next person, but I've made so much fun of myself over the years, and that's very salutary as you grow older."
Jean Smart,It's fun to do accents; it's fun to do different periods - that's why you become an actor. Because it's fun to be a storyteller and play make-believe.
Pete Carroll,"Think of your favorite teacher you ever had in school: the one who made it the most fun to go to class. They surprise you. They keep you guessing. They keep you coming back, wanting to know what's going to happen next."
Craig Sager,"If I've learned anything through all of this, it's that each and every day is a canvas waiting to be painted - an opportunity for love, for fun, for living, for learning."
Paul Feig,The dueling maturity levels in high school is such a source of comedy to me. I was always such a late developer. I was last to walk. I was last to ride a bike. I was last to have sex. That's why it's fun to portray one side of your childhood onscreen.
Rich Lowry,"Comedians still make fun of Bill's out-of-control appetites, but with Hillary, the mockery is about how she lets nothing be out of control."
Dick Van Dyke,"My career is over. I'm just playing now and having a great time. I like to keep busy, and I'm doing what's fun for me."
Giancarlo Stanton,I play to have fun. I play to win. I play for my teammates.
Lisa Hanawalt,"The way I eat in my day-to-day life is, like, very simple to the point of being absurd. Like, my boyfriend makes fun of me because if I'm eating a snack, it's often, like, a pickle and then a hard-boiled egg and then crackers and then maybe a carrot, and it's like I'm eating like a baby."
Geoffrey Zakarian,"When I entertain, I want to have fun. But I'm also a control person. I don't go in for those everyone-in-the-kitchen cooking scenes. So if I want to be with my guests, I have to do everything - or nearly everything - in advance."
Jenny Han,"Sometimes readers want some escapist fun, to get lost in the story. But light-hearted romantic stories can and should star all kinds of girls."
Salman Rushdie,"There was a series called 'Game of Thrones' which was very popular here in the United States, a post-Tolkien kind of thing. It was garbage, yet very addictive garbage - because there's lots of violence, all the women take their clothes off all the time, and it's kind of fun."
Dick Van Dyke,"Dick Martin was a good buddy, and he was always a lot of fun to have around."
GG Allin,I don't want people to think that I can't make fun of myself.
Emma Watson,I used to look back at pictures and cringe but actually I'm quite proud that I've had fun with fashion and don't always look perfect. The only regret I have is when I look at something I wore when I was very young and it obviously looks like it belonged to someone else.
Nick Cannon,"It's fun having songs about parties and gigolos, but I really wanted to use my music as a form of art. Art is supposed to spark conversation and make people think, and I wanted to do that with this song."
Mike May,The fun thing about getting older is finding younger people to mentor.
Adam Rippon,"If you ever have the option, come to the Olympics. It's, like, a fun time."
Jeremy Howard,"Acting was always something fun to do on the side growing up, but I never really took it seriously. I would do a commercial every few months, and that paid my school tuition. But in high school, I was mostly into sports and didn't go out for stuff during those seasons."
Caitlin Rose,"'Gorilla Man' is a composite of a few individuals, but the song itself was actually inspired by James Taylor. I spied his 'Gorilla' album laying on my floor and in some altered state, instantly started singing the chorus. It was fun to write. There's an old notebook with at least three more verses in it somewhere."
Paul Dini,"I was writing a script about the Joker menacing a regular person who had strayed into his path, and I needed to give him a gang of henchmen to work with him. The idea occurred to me, let's put in a female henchperson, because that seemed like a fun variation on the regular big thug guys."
Garth Brooks,"I don't know of too many double Christmas albums, so it is something that's new, and hopefully will be fun, and there's plenty of stuff out there to cut."
Maisie Williams,"When I was in primary school, my best friend was a boy and we always goofed around, climbed trees, got holes in my trousers and muddied all my tops and things like that; a complete nightmare for the washing, but great fun."
Taylor Lautner,"I love to have fun and goof around and be silly, so anybody who can also do that is good for me."
Don Rickles,"I shouldn't make fun of the blacks: President Obama is a personal friend of mine. He was over to the house yesterday, but the mop broke."
Future,The most fun moments are being on the stage and seeing how the crowd reacts to your music. The energy of the crowd that makes you just want to go in and keep doing it and be a part of this forever.
Patch Adams,"I'm great at a deathbed. I've never given tranquillisers or psychiatric medicine. I've given love and fun and creativity and passion and hope, and these things ease suffering."

Roy Clark,"Music was my salvation, the thing I loved most and did best. Whatever was fun, I'd go do that."
Jimmy Cliff,"With acting, you have to become someone else. That's the fun part of it for me - to step outside of yourself and become a character. I guess being Jimmy Cliff is a little bit of a character, too."
Bindi Irwin,My Daddy was my hero. He was always there for me when I needed him. He listened to me and taught me so many things. But most of all he was fun.
Alia Bhatt,I need to be bad. I don't want to burn out. I also don't want to be a person who is always performance-oriented. I also want to have some fun.
Krist Novoselic,Sunshine Cake is just a fun hobby thing. That's about it.
Edmund Phelps,I started to think about what drives innovation and what its social significance might be. The next step was to think innovators are taking a leap into the unknown. That led me to the thought that it is also a source of fun and employee engagement.
George A. Romero,"With CG, I can do more and be sillier. In 'Diary,' there's a scene where they hit a guy with acid, and the camera is never off him, and you see it gradually eat through his skull and get all the way through his brain. That's fun, too."
Jim James,"I've just had this idea pop in my head of trying to learn a new song every da, and try and play it that night. That's been fun for me because it's a little bit of a scary adventure, playing a song for the first time in front of people and letting it just be what it is."
Aidan Gallagher,Anytime you approach a new season of any show it's fun because you have a newfound history with these characters.
Chang-Rae Lee,"What's fun about a dystopian novel is that we can enjoy and be entertained. But that world is only slightly different, right? It's familiar enough to be recognizable, and skewed enough to give us pause."
Madelaine Petsch,"We had South African accents. I was a vegan. I was raised without religion. I was just the weirdest kid in this small town, so I got made fun of a lot for it."
Mandy Moore,"I think I had the most fun making a movie with 'Dedication,' just because you knew that it was a passion project for everyone involved. We had X amount of days to shoot New York in the cold. No trailers. Just sort of kind of doing it guerilla style in a way."
Kate Spade,"The idea of recklessly spending money - even though it sounds like it's lots of fun, it's fashion - isn't interesting to me. It is a business."
Rob Manuel,"Trolling taps into people's desire to poke fun, make trouble and cause annoyance."
Mose Allison,"There's a lot of terrible things goin' on all the time, but you gotta try and have some fun in the end."

Paul McCartney,Being in the audience actually looks like quite a lot of fun.
Lea Salonga,"When I'm doing a one-on-one with somebody, I have to speak in a language that that person can understand, using a vocabulary that they instantly get, and I always have to feel my way around to figure that out. It's a lot of fun, and it's also really challenging - challenging in a different way from performing."
Scarface,"I play golf every day if I can, but it's not fun and games for me."
Mac DeMarco,"I'm just trying to have fun, and maybe the way I hold myself kind of freaks people out. I don't feel like an outsider, and I think my friends feel the same way I do. Now that we're playing to larger audiences, maybe we're weird to some people. But I'm trying to express what I am."
Lisa Hanawalt,"I think, a lot of time, when I'm making art, I'm trying to get into a state of childlike play, where I'm not self-conscious; I'm not worried about what the outcome is going to be. I'm just having fun."
Alex Flinn,Any experience that isn't fun is probably something I will at least use in my writing someday.
Lindsey Morgan,I've done some Muay Thai training just for fun.
Ray Bradbury,"The answer I found is you stay away from the people who make fun of you, and you join these ad hoc groups who understand your craziness."
Carrie Underwood,"When I got into all the grunge stuff, I really liked Hole. I actually saw them in concert when I was a sophomore in high school. It was kind of rare to see a successful female rocker get down and dirty with the guys. And Courtney Love did. It was fun to be a fan of something different."
Martha Beck,"Once we're willing to confront our emotional suffering, we begin making choices based on attraction instead of aversion, love instead of fear. Where we used to think about what was 'safe,' we now become interested in doing what seems right or fun or meaningful or ripe with possibilities."
Preity Zinta,"Shopping is a lot of fun, but I hate trying on clothes because I think I've done too many costume fittings and trials. I hate trying on clothes. Shoes I love. I mean, I love shoes. Anywhere, any place, any time, you take me to a shoe store."
David Green,"This is my hobby: growing stores, adding stores. It's fun."
Jam Master Jay,Going to your set with the headphones on in the middle of the night so that your parents don't know what you're doing when you're supposed to be asleep is great. I was rocking the bedroom. That was so much more fun when I got the 1200s.
Jackie Mason,"There is no way I would ever want to be president for a second. It's much easier to make fun of them on the stage and get paid for it. With all the years of me lampooning the presidents in my act, I know I could never ever want that job."
Kate Herron,"Alligator Loki, who knows what the alligator's story could be? That was always fun - the debate about whether it's a Loki, or if it's just an alligator with horns on its head. I think he is a Loki."
